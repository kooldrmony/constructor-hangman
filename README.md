# constructor-hangman

Description

This constructor-hangman game is a game that was engineered using node.js and the command line. It was designed to incorporate the use of constructors and be able to require them from different files and use them to make the game work. 

This particular game has Simpson's based theme so it is a real treat for Simpson's fans.
